## kmspd: k-means on SPD matrices in R

This repository holds code and data for the paper [k-means on Positive Definite Matrices, and an Application to Clustering in Radar Image Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03454.pdf) by [Daniel Fryer](www.danielvfryer.com), [Hien Nguyen](www.hiendn.github.io) and [Pascal Castellazzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-castellazzi-b9533ba0/).

### Features

The script [R/SAR_application.R](R/SAR_application.R) calls functions that save their intermediary results in Rds format. These functions check for previously saved results before executing. So, most computationally intensive tasks need not be repeated more than once -- making for easier / quicker interactive exploratory analysis! 

### Structure

* [R/SAR_application.R](R/SAR_application.R) is the script that produces all results in the paper.

* [SAR_app_data/MG](SAR_app_data/MG) contains pre-processed SAR data.
* [results](results) contains figures and other results produced in the code.
